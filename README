PLEASE READ BEFORE COMMITTING CHANGES TO WWW.GNOME.ORG

The gnome-web-www's repository currently has two branches:

- master (linked to www.gnome.org) 
- wptest (linked to wptest.gnome.org)

As you can see, each branch is linked to a git's hook that automatically
updates a relevant GNOME website by grabbing the latest content from the
above repositories. Wptest exists as a testing bed for changes to be made at wgo.

That said, if you want to test your changes before deploying them on the main wgo website,
please commit them to the wptest branch first, but how can you do that? There are two ways to
handle that:

1. git clone -b wptest ssh://USERNAME@git.gnome.org/git/gnome-web-www
2. git clone ssh://USERNAME@git.gnome.org/git/gnome-web-www ; git checkout wptest

The first command will directly clone the wptest branch itself, then you'll
just have to edit something, commit it and push it with a simple git push. (i.e without
specifying branch's name) From there, once your changes have been tested, by looking at the changes on wptest.gnome.org, and approved, you will need to add the changes to the master branch by:
1. git checkout master
2. git merge wptest

The second command will clone the entire repository and switch you to the
wptest branch, you can then move to edit files, commit, merge from master
and push to the desired branch.
