                <p>Outreachy helps people from groups underrepresented in free and open source software get involved. We provide a supportive community for beginning to contribute any time throughout the year and offer focused internship opportunities twice a year with a number of free software organizations.</p>
                <p>The current round of internships is open to women (cis and trans), trans men, genderqueer people, and all participants of the <a href="http://ascendproject.org/">Ascend Project</a> regardless of gender. We are planning to expand the program to more participants from underrepresented backgrounds in the future.</p>
                <p>Outreachy is the successor of the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/opw">Outreach Program for Women</a>. You can learn who participated in and sponsored the last round of internships on <a href="http://www.gnome.org/opw">its site</a>. Companies are <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy/Admin/InfoForOrgs">invited</a> to express interest in sponsoring the current round of the program by March 24, 2015.</p>

full-time internships will run from May 25 to August 25. Coding, design, documentation and other projects are available. The applicants are asked to select a project with one of the <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy/2015/MayAugust#Participating_Organizations">participating organizations</a> and collaborate with a mentor listed for that project to make a relevant contribution to the project during the application process. <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy">Detailed information</a> about the background for the program, requirements for participants, how to select a project, and how to make a contribution is available.

            <p>Applicants who are students interested in coding projects are <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy#GSoC">encouraged</a> to apply for <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015">Google Summer of Code</a> as well. The administrators of both programs will coordinate to accept the top applicants for one of the programs.

            <p> The accepted participants work remotely, while being guided by their mentor, and receive $5,500 stipend. It's expected that the participants are able to have the internship work be a primary focus during the internship dates and spend 40 hours a week on it.

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Outreachy is the successor of the Outreach Program for Women (OPW). OPW was inspired by Google Summer of Code and by how few women applied for it. The GNOME Foundation first started OPW with one round in 2006, and then resumed the effort in 2010 with rounds organized twice a year. In the May 2012 round, Software Freedom Conservancy joined OPW with one internship with the Twisted project. In the January 2013 round, many other free and open source organizations joined the program. For the May 2015 round, the program was renamed to Outreachy with the goal of expanding to engage people from various underrepresented groups and was moved to Software Freedom Conservancy as its organizational home.</p>

            <p>This program is a welcoming link that connects <strong>talented and passionate newcomers</strong> with people working in free and open source software and guides them through their first contribution. Through Outreachy, participants learn how exciting and valuable work on software freedom can be, while helping us to build a more inclusive community. </p>
