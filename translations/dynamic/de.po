"Shuttleworth’s comment that “Linux, the Free software system, is not "
"thriving on the client” set off another series of comments and rebuttals "
"about funding vs contribution. In order for FOSS to thrive in the desktop "
"environment, Mark says that companies–especially startups–need what "
"copyright assignment offers. It gives them a competitive advantage which "
"makes it easier for them to make money. Meeks agreed that a stronger, "
"broader ecosystem would be great, but copyright assignment defeats the point "
"of Free Software as it creates monopolies. Mark didn’t like to talk about "
"monopolies, as “in terms of access to the code there is no monopoly”, but "
"Bradley disagreed, pointing out that, under most assignment circumstances, "
"only one company can take the code proprietary. This is indeed the "
"‘competitive advantage’ which was being discussed."

"We spoke with Karen Sandler on this subject afterwards, asking for her "
"personal view in this. She agrees on this point, noting that a GPL “or "
"later” kind of license effectively commits a contributor to a license they "
"have not yet seen. This worries even some developers who trust the FSF, as "
"the FSF is the organization which can then incorporate new things with a "
"later version of the GPL. If the code is owned by a strong, independent, "
"charitable entity which is trusted by the contributors, they can ensure the "
"goals of the community and the license stay aligned. This trust can be "
"achieved in a number of ways, including assignment agreements that limit how "
"the code can be licensed later, or by ensuring election of leadership by a "
"broad membership. However, she opposes assigning the code to a corporate "
"party due to the earlier mentioned monopoly on the ability to take the code "
"proprietary, which goes against the software freedom ideals she supports. It "
"gives them too much power, something Meeks also brought up several times."

"On the issue of patents, the differences of opinion were again on display. "

"rights back from the company with respect to patents that they themselves "
"are expected to provide. Meeks said he has problems with the inequality "
"which is created by the copyright assignment and he believes there’s enough "
"competition already, we don’t need an advantage for a single company. He "
"pointed out that contributors could end up in a situation where even they "
"themselves don’t have the right to ship the software they wrote themselves, "
"despite a permissive license, because the patents are owned by the company "
"they assigned their code to."

"The final core day of GUADEC began with a keynote by Cathy Malmrose. Cathy "
"is CEO of <_:a-1/>, which sells computers pre-installed with Linux. She "
"talked about the goals of ZaReason: to provide beautiful, high-end computers "
"that can be freely used. ZaReason machines are used by FedEx, NASA’s jet "
"propulsion labs and Stanford’s AI Lab, among many others, and uses local "
"shops for assembly and support."

"Cathy spoke passionately about the affinity between ZaReason and GNOME, and "
"her desire for a closer working relationship. She said: “To thrive F/LOSS "
"must be part of the hardware chain. Hardware &amp; software must work "
"together.” For her, GNOME has all the pieces and has produced an incredibly "
"valuable codebase that she wants to support."

"Then it was time for talks. Juan Pablo Ugarte presented CSS support in the "
"Glade interface designer. There were cheers when he revealed that he had "
"created his presentation slides – which included animated backgrounds – "
"purely using Glade, which even let him export to PDF. Alejandro Piñeiro "
"Iglesias and Joanmarie Diggs also spoke about their work on PDF tagging, "
"which improves formatting and accessibility."

"Stef Walter’s “More secure with less ‘security’” provoked an extremely "
"positive reaction. He talked about plans to improve the security of GNOME "
"software while also enhancing the user experience. As Stef talked, the "
"auditorium Twitter wall filled up with comments like “A sudden outbreak of "
"common sense!” and “Stef talks gold”. At the same time, Anish Patil and Mike "
"Fabian gave a talk on their recent predictive input methods, which allows an "
"input method to automatically complete words as the user types. They "
"described how necessary it is to have effective features like this for parts "
"of the world like indea, where there are more than 25 languages."

"After lunch, Martin Robinson and Carlos García Campos gave a talk on the "
"work done to integratie WebKit2 into GNOME for version 3.8. This was a major "
"undertaking, and brought new features and enhancements to the platform. "
"Martin and Carlos discussed some of these, and gave advice to application "
"authors on how to best take advantage of them. In the other room, Marta "
"Maria Casetti presented her work to produce guides and tutorials for new "
"programmers working with GNOME technologies. Giving his second talk of the "
"conference, Jeff Fortin presented the latest development work on PiTiVi, a "
"GNOME video editor application."

"The end of the day – and the final session of the core days – was interns’ "
"lightning talks. A large audience gathered to hear about the many projects "
"that have been undertaken by interns on the Outreach Program for Women and "
"Google Summer of Code. A huge number of topics were covered, including dual "
"screen presentation mode in Evince, a new GNOME avatar picker dialog, work "
"on geolocation support, PitiVi, GCompris, redesigned Date &amp; Time "
"settings, a new Maps application, focus and caret tracking in the screen "
"magnifier feature, a new sound recorder application, a major upgrade to "
"Cantarell (the GNOME font), porting color management to Wayland, folder "
"encryption support in Nautilus, search and selections in the new Music "
"application and an F-Spot faces tool. There was a round of applause when we "
"heard that one of the interns has taken over maintainership of the GNOME "
"Dictionary. We also saw the return of Richard Schwarting’s Foxy mascot."

"As the core day came to a close, the conference organizers took to the stage "
"and were given a huge standing ovation for all their work. Many of the "
"conference attendees then embarked on a walking tour of Brno, which gave "
"them a chance to see some more of the city and learn its history."
