"The panel was made up of key figures in the Free Software community from "
"both sides of the debate. Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Canonical, promoted "
"contributor agreements as essential to building a thriving ecosystem around "
"Free Software. Michael Meeks, part of the LibreOffice founding team and long "
"time GNOME contributor, explained how he was once in favor of assigning his "
"copyright to larger projects. Now he has come to see problems in terms of "
"what he calls the “Scalability, Copyright and Ownership” problems. Most "
"companies that require copyright assignment (e.g., MySQL) end up doing most "
"of the work themselves rather than getting real support from the community. "
"Moreover, you can expect conflicts and FUD due to copyright issues. Finally, "
"CA leads to less feeling of ownership by the community which in turn leads "
"to maintenance problems. Bradley Kuhn of the Software Freedom Conservancy "
"and the Free Software Foundation is also generally against copyright "
"assignment to companies, arguing that projects choose licenses that reflect "
"their values and contributor agreements change that."

"copyright assignment offers. It gives them a competitive advantage which "
"makes it easier for them to make money. Meeks agreed that a stronger, "
"broader ecosystem would be great, but copyright assignment defeats the point "
"of Free Software as it creates monopolies. Mark didn’t like to talk about "
"monopolies, as “in terms of access to the code there is no monopoly”, but "
"Bradley disagreed, pointing out that, under most assignment circumstances, "
"only one company can take the code proprietary. This is indeed the "

"We spoke with Karen Sandler on this subject afterwards, asking for her "

"the FSF is the organization which can then incorporate new things with a "
"later version of the GPL. If the code is owned by a strong, independent, "

"goals of the community and the license stay aligned. This trust can be "
"achieved in a number of ways, including assignment agreements that limit how "

"broad membership. However, she opposes assigning the code to a corporate "

"are expected to provide. Meeks said he has problems with the inequality "

"competition already, we don’t need an advantage for a single company. He "
