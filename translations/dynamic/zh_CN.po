"“Our goal was to build accessibility into the initial design, giving the "
"GNOME application developers uniformity across components by implementing "
"one standard API, while at the same time providing extensibility” – said "
"Robert O’Dea, Director of GNOME engineering at Sun Ireland. “Also, our "
"design philosophy took into consideration the many graphical toolkits that "
"could take advantage of the agnostic approach of the AT SPI toolkit — this "
"strategy saves time by eliminating the need to reinvent accessibility for "
"each platform. Developers can get started with the Accessibility Framework "
"now. We have documentation and engineering support in place to help make the "
"upcoming release of GNOME 2.0 Accessible by first customer ship. In "
"addition, our Accessibility Lab is in place to help assistive technology "

"companies that require copyright assignment (e.g., MySQL) end up doing most "
"of the work themselves rather than getting real support from the community. "
"Moreover, you can expect conflicts and FUD due to copyright issues. Finally, "
"CA leads to less feeling of ownership by the community which in turn leads "
"to maintenance problems. Bradley Kuhn of the Software Freedom Conservancy "
"and the Free Software Foundation is also generally against copyright "

"copyright assignment offers. It gives them a competitive advantage which "
"makes it easier for them to make money. Meeks agreed that a stronger, "
"broader ecosystem would be great, but copyright assignment defeats the point "
"of Free Software as it creates monopolies. Mark didn’t like to talk about "
"monopolies, as “in terms of access to the code there is no monopoly”, but "

"We spoke with Karen Sandler on this subject afterwards, asking for her "

"the FSF is the organization which can then incorporate new things with a "

"competition already, we don’t need an advantage for a single company. He "
